<h1>Self Development Technique #1</h1>
<h2>Cold Showers</h2>
<p>The moment that freezing cold water hits my body, I am in extreme agony and discomfort. The only thoughts I am hearing in my mind are "Turn on the hot water!", "You don't have to go through this pain!". But I refuse to give in to my mind whose only job is to keep me "safe". I refuse to be "safe". To me, safe = mediocrity and God did not create me to be mediocre. I take cold showers every day to tell myself that for the rest of your life, you are always going to feel some type of discomfort, but are you going to turn the knob to the safe side or are you going to fight the pain in order to live out your greatest potential</p>
